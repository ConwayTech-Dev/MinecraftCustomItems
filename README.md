# Minecraft Custom Items

My collection of Minecraft custom items. __None__ require mods!

# Installation

All of these items are for Minecraft 1.18-1.18.2. If you want to try out one of these items, simply click on the command for the item you want (which will be located in this repo), copy the command, paste it into a command block, and trigger it (i.e. with a button or pressure plate).

# Other Stuff

I will *not* be porting or backporting these items to different versions. However, because Minecraft versions like 1.17 and 1.19 are similar to 1.18, feel free to fork this repo and convert the items to such versions.
Also, if you'd like to add these items to a villager, making it sell the items to the villager, I suggest Gamer Geeks' villager generator at https://www.gamergeeks.net/apps/minecraft/mob-generator/summon-villager.
